What is Image Classification?
The classification problem is to categorize all the pixels of a digital image into one of the defined classes.
Image classification is the most critical use case in digital image analysis.
Image classification is an application of both supervised classification and unsupervised classification.
In supervised classification, we select samples for each target class. We train our neural network on these target class samples and then classify new samples.
In unsupervised classification, we group the sample images into clusters of images having similar properties. Then, we classify each cluster into our intended classes.
